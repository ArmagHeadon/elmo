    "comment": "This is a tracker bug for releasing Firefox {{ loc }}.\n\nYour team's dashboard should be up on http://l10n.mozilla.org/teams/{{ loc }}. The dashboard displays your project's status and helps you (and us) determine what's left to do. Follow it closely to track your Firefox localization progress. You will see this bug listed as part of your dashboard. This helps us to track your project's progress and provide visibility to your work.\n\nThe \"bugs\" here are tracking individual items of work. Some of those will depend on the localization team driving them to completion, while others are for infrastructure that will be handled by Mozilla staff. I'll indicate who is responsible in each bug.\n\nWe'll also be using two terms for interacting with version control. That's commonly mercurial, or hg, in short. \"commit\" is used when talking about the actual 'hg commit' command, adding changes to the local version history. \"landing\" means to commit something and to use 'hg push' to push it from your local version history to the one on hg.mozilla.org, mozilla's server. That's when your changes are public, and make it into the builds Mozilla generates, and puts on ftp.\n\nIf you're unsure what any of the terminology means, feel free to ask. Good places are http://www.mozilla.org/about/forums/#dev-l10n-new-locales or #l10n. Ask in public, you shouldn't assume that you're the only one with the question.",
