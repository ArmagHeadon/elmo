Getting started
---------------

[The wiki](https://github.com/mozilla/elmo/wiki) has everything you
need to know for getting up and running locally, how to run tests and
how to contribute code.

Since we're using [git flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) most
activity is happening on the ``develop`` branch. To get into the code
quickly run this command:

```
git clone -b develop --recursive git://github.com/mozilla/elmo.git
```
